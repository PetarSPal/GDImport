# GDIncImport

POC

Queue up a selection of files to be incremenetally imported without further need of attention.
Once import is clicked the rest of file copying and import happens in automatically.
A detached godot instance is launched sequentially to process every batch of files.
The detached instance quits when it's done importing.
